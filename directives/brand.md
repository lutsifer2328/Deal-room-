I. Brand UI & UX Strategy
The interface must feel like an extension of agenzia.bg—modern, high-end, and "Legal-Tech."

Color Palette:

Primary: Midnight Blue (#0A1F33) — Used for headers and primary authority buttons.

Secondary: Agency Teal (#17A2B8) — Used for progress bars and active steps.

Accent: Soft Gold (#C5A059) — Used for "Lawyer Verified" stamps and premium highlights.

Background: Off-White/Cool Gray (#F8F9FA) — To keep the interface clean and reduce user anxiety.

Typography: Professional Sans-Serif (e.g., Montserrat or Open Sans) with heavy weights for headings to convey strength.

The "Feel": Minimalist. No cluttered sidebars. Only show the user what they need to do now.
